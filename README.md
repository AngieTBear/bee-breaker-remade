# Brick Breaker Remake 

A personalized remake of a Brick Breaker game originally developed during my coursework at Full Sail University. Originally built in C++ using Visual Studio, now remade with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About the Project

This project is a Brick Breaker arcade game where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and destroy bricks. This remake was an opportunity to reimagine the project using web and to improve the overall design and gameplay from my orignal game.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Play

- Move the paddle left and right using your keyboard (Arrow keys or A/D keys).
- Bounce the ball off the paddle to break all the bricks.
- Don't let the ball fall below the paddle â€” or it's game over!
- (future goals: add special features later, like levels or power-ups)
